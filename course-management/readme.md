# Course Management System

Django app, which implements Course Management System that holds courses and lectures. 
Every course has: 

* Name - unique
* Description
* Start Date
* End Date
* Approximate Duration


Every lecture has:

* Name - should be unique
* Description
* Start Date
* End Date

After we have added one course, we can search for it by its name in the url, as well as we can edit all the attributes of that course.

For every course we have lectures, we can add and alter by its unique id.
