# Money In The Bank

## A python project that represents registration and login into a bank system.
   
### The main techniques we use are:

* Preventing a SQL injection.

* Validating and making the passwords strong enough.

They must have at least 8 symbols, capital letters, numbers, special symbols.  

* Hashing the passwords.

* Hiding the passwords while typing.

* Bruteforce protection. 

The user is blocked for a few seconds if he tries more than 3 times to login with wrong username or password.
